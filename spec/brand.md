# Gitcoin Brand Overview

This document summarizes the Gitcoin brand aesthetic, philosophy, and color system.
It is intended for engineers, designers, and contributors building Gitcoin-aligned products, interfaces, or experiments.

The goal of the Gitcoin brand is coherence without rigidity.
Gitcoin is designed as a living ecosystem, not a static corporate identity.

---

## Brand Philosophy

Gitcoin represents public goods funding as an ecological and cultural system.

Core ideas expressed through the brand:
- coordination over extraction
- ecosystems over platforms
- community over corporation
- regeneration over optimization
- long-term stewardship over short-term gains

The visual identity intentionally avoids cold enterprise aesthetics.
It favors organic, networked, and human-centered design cues.

The brand supports experimentation, plurality, and evolution while remaining recognizably Gitcoin.

---

## Visual Identity Principles

- wordmark-first identity
- simple, modern typography
- high legibility over decoration
- soft backgrounds and restrained accents
- biomimetic and nature-inspired metaphors
- flexibility across products and contexts

Icons, illustrations, and textures should feel organic, not mechanical.
Gradients are atmospheric, not noisy.
Visual density stays low to medium.

---

## Color System Overview

Gitcoin does not use a single fixed palette.
Instead, it operates with mode-based color systems that map to different narratives and use cases.

Pick one mode per surface or experience.
Do not mix modes arbitrarily.

Accents are used sparingly to guide attention.

If something feels corporate, over-designed, or salesy, it is probably off-brand.
