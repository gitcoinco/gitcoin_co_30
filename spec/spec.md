## [**Gitcoin.co**](http://Gitcoin.co) **in 2026 \+**

### **Ethereum’s Funding App Store and Reference Library**

### **Problem**

Gitcoin earned its position as the place where Ethereum funds its most important problems in 2019-2021 via QF. Over time, the ecosystem evolved. Funding mechanisms multiplied. New platforms, DAOs, funds, and experiments emerged. Gitcoin increasingly found itself competing inside the arena rather than shaping it.

The result: fragmentation, diluted narrative gravity, and a loss of Gitcoin’s role as the default starting point for Ethereum public goods funding.

### **Pivot**

To restore Gitcoin’s standing, we should stop competing in the arena and instead curate the entire funding landscape.

The opportunity is to turn Gitcoin.co into **Ethereum’s funding app store**: the trusted directory and reference library for what actually works in funding for the new era.

### **The Product**

Gitcoin.co becomes a living CMS that documents and curates:

* **Documents:**  
  * **Apps**: funding platforms, DAOs, grant programs, funds, and primitives  
  * **Mechanisms**: quadratic funding, retro funding, conviction voting, streaming, trust-based models, hybrids  
  * **Case Studies**: what was funded, how, outcomes, lessons learned  
  * **Research & Trends**: analysis of capital flows, mechanism performance, and ecosystem shifts  
  * **Campaigns:** What is happening now and soon?  Highlight them and give them distribution.  
* Submit functionality.  
  * Ability for anyone to write/edit a document.  Enabling a community to swarm around it.  
* 

This positions Gitcoin as the **intellectual center of Ethereum funding**, not just a participant.

### **Strategic Advantage**

This approach allows Gitcoin to:

* Embrace plural mechanism funding without picking winners  
* “Bear hug” competitors by featuring them rather than fighting them  
* Sit above the fray as the curator of dealflow, narrative, and legitimacy  
* Generate social gravity, partnerships, and inbound collaboration

Instead of being one funding mechanism, Gitcoin becomes the **map of the funding universe**.

### **Ecosystem Flywheel**

This model institutionalizes work already happening organically:

* Long-form analysis and synthesis, similar to Owocki’s X articles or Sov’s grant farm  
* Media and narrative infrastructure like the Greenpill podcast  
* Research and venture insights emerging from Allo-adjacent work

Over time, initiatives like Allo Capital and the Greenpill Podcast can be brought in-house to reinforce Gitcoin as the canonical source of truth, capital, and narrative around public goods.

### **Campaigns as Features**

Future launches like GG25 or Trustless Trust do not replace this model. They plug into it.

Major Gitcoin initiatives become **featured campaigns** on the homepage of the funding app store, alongside the broader ecosystem they sit within. This reframes launches from one-off events into highlighted examples of a larger, ongoing system.

### **Outcome**

Gitcoin is no longer just where funding happens.

Gitcoin is where people go to understand:

* What funding mechanisms exist  
* What has worked  
* Who is building  
* Where capital should flow next

This is a pillar of how Gitcoin restores its role as the premier place where Ethereum funds solutions to its most important problems.

### **Questions**

- Who is the audience?  
  - First, the 500 mechanism/funding nerds.  
  - Then, the 10k ppl who want funding or to give out funding  
  - Then, the world.  
- How will we track success?  
  - Leading indicator: Traffic goes up  
    - Organic social shares go up  
  - Trailing indicator; Leads go up  
- What happens to the old [Gitcoin.co](http://Gitcoin.co)?  
  - It’s slowly retired as the new content replaces it.  
  - Eg [impact.gitcoin.co](http://impact.gitcoin.co) \=\> case studies get moved over.  
  - Other resources like the Grants maturity framework get moved over.  
- Who is in charge of building the content?  
  - The new marketing lead drives.  
  - \+ Owocki \+ Carey assisting.  
  - \+ Networked based bounties for building out parts of it. Eg $100/pop for case studies/mechanisms/research that reach our quality standards.  
- What about the timeline?  
  - I have urgency to change existing site sooner rather than latest to signal that Gitcoin is evolving.  
  - Aim to replace existing site with a lean version of this by around ETHBoulder.  
  - Then plug in ETHBoulder community to swarm around researching it \+ building it out.  
- What about the brand?  
  - We can launch this with a MVP new brand.  
- What about the tech?  
  - We shoudl build this on a good CMS platform.
