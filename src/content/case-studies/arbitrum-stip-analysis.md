**Project:** Short-Term Incentive Program
**Platform:** arbitrum-dao-grants
**Mechanism:** Direct Grants
**Funding Amount:** 71.4M ARB
**Funding Date:** November 1, 2023
**Status:** Partial Success
**Author:** Gitcoin Research

**Outcomes:**
- **Tokens Distributed:** 71.4M ARB distributed as incentives
- **Protocols Funded:** 56 recipient protocols
- **Learning Value:** Informed design of LTIP program

**Lessons Learned:**
- User retention is harder than acquisition with incentives
- Incentive mechanism design significantly impacts outcomes
- Robust measurement frameworks are essential
- Short-term programs generate long-term learnings

## Background

In late 2023, Arbitrum DAO launched the Short-Term Incentive Program (STIP), distributing 71.4M ARB tokens (~$100M at peak) to 56 ecosystem protocols to drive usage and growth.

## The Mechanism

STIP used a grant-based approach:
- Protocols applied for incentive allocations
- DAO voted on applications
- Recipients distributed ARB as user incentives
- Metrics tracking was required but inconsistent

## Mixed Results

The program showed both successes and challenges:

**Positives:**
- TVL increased significantly during the program
- Many protocols gained new users
- Created ecosystem coordination and awareness
- Demonstrated DAO governance at scale

**Challenges:**
- Mercenary capital left after incentives ended
- Some protocols used incentives inefficiently
- High cost per retained user in many cases
- Limited long-term user retention

## Key Metrics

- **71.4M ARB distributed** to 56 protocols
- **TVL peaked** during incentive period
- **User retention** varied significantly by protocol
- **Cost per retained user** ranged from reasonable to very high

## Learnings Applied to LTIP

The STIP experience directly informed the Long-Term Incentive Pilot (LTIP):
- Longer timeframes for sustainability
- Better measurement frameworks
- Focus on retention metrics
- More structured reporting requirements
