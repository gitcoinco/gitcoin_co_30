- **Rounds Operated:** 15+ core and community rounds
- **Total Distributed:** $2.5M+ combined matching and contributions
- **Unique Donors:** 15,000+ contributors across all rounds

**Lessons Learned:**
- Communities can effectively self-organize funding rounds
- Shared infrastructure reduces barriers to entry
- Quality curation remains essential
- Unified sybil resistance improves efficiency

## Background

Gitcoin Grants 20 in April 2024 showcased the evolution of Gitcoin from a single platform to an ecosystem of community-run funding rounds. Multiple independent communities ran their own QF rounds using Grants Stack infrastructure.

## The Model

GG20 featured:
- Core Gitcoin-organized rounds (Web3 OSS, Climate, etc.)
- Community partner rounds with independent matching pools
- Shared sybil resistance via Gitcoin Passport
- Decentralized round management

## Key Rounds

Several notable rounds ran:
- **Web3 Open Source Software**: Core infrastructure funding
- **Climate Solutions**: Environmental impact projects
- **Ethereum Infrastructure**: Protocol-level tooling
- **Community rounds**: Partner-organized thematic rounds

## Outcomes

The round demonstrated that QF can scale through decentralization:
- **Multiple communities** successfully ran independent rounds
- **Diverse funding sources** provided matching pools
- **Reduced centralization** on Gitcoin core team
- **Quality varied** by round operator experience

## Sybil Resistance

Gitcoin Passport provided unified sybil resistance:
- Users collect verifiable credentials
- Passport scores determine matching weight
- Shared across all rounds for efficiency
- Continuously improving detection
