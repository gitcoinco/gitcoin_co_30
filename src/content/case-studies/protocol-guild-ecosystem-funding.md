**Project:** Protocol Guild
**Platform:** protocol-guild
**Mechanism:** Streaming
**Funding Amount:** $92.9M+
**Funding Date:** May 1, 2022
**Status:** Success
**Author:** Gitcoin Research

**Outcomes:**
- **Total Funding:** $92.9M+ pledges and donations from ecosystem
- **Contributors Funded:** 187+ active Ethereum core protocol developers
- **Ecosystem Adoption:** 50+ major protocols contributing to infrastructure

**Lessons Learned:**
- Collective funding mechanisms enable what individual funding cannot

## Background

Protocol Guild launched in May 2022 to address a critical gap: Ethereum core protocol contributors were underfunded relative to the value they create. The Ethereum base layer enables billions in DeFi TVL, yet the ~180 developers maintaining it had inconsistent funding.

## The Mechanism

Protocol Guild uses a novel approach:
- Contributors are weighted by tenure and active participation
- Funds vest over 4 years, ensuring long-term commitment
- A simple split contract distributes funds to all members
- Anyone can donate, and major protocols are encouraged to contribute

## Key Contributors

Major pledges include:
- **Lido DAO**: 2% of staking rewards (~$20M+ pledged)
- **Uniswap**: $2.5M in UNI tokens
- **ENS**: 200,000 ENS tokens (~$2.7M)
- **Optimism**: 500,000 OP tokens
- **Arbitrum Foundation**: Significant ARB allocation

## Outcomes

As of late 2024:
- **$92.9M+ in total pledges and donations received**
- **187+ active Ethereum core contributors** receiving funding
- **4-year vesting** ensures long-term alignment
- Major protocols now recognize infrastructure funding as essential

## Lessons Learned

1. **Collective action works**: Individual contributors are hard to fund, but a collective is fundable
2. **Make it easy**: One contract to fund all core devs reduces coordination overhead
3. **Align incentives**: Vesting and tenure weighting reward long-term contribution
4. **Frame as self-interest**: Protocols benefit from a well-funded base layer
