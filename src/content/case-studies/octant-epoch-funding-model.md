## Background

Octant, launched by the Golem Foundation, created a novel funding model: stake 100,000 ETH and use the staking rewards to fund public goods. Users lock GLM tokens to participate in allocation decisions.

## The Mechanism

Octant runs 90-day epochs:
1. **100,000 ETH staked** generates rewards
2. **GLM lockers** earn proportional ETH rewards
3. Users choose to **donate or claim** their rewards
4. Donations go to **curated public goods projects**
5. **Quadratic funding** determines final allocations

## 9 Epochs of Funding

Through 9 epochs (as of late 2024):
- **$15M+ total** distributed to public goods
- **$1-2M per epoch** average funding
- **Diverse project portfolio** across categories
- **Growing participation** over time

## Sustainability Model

The model is sustainable because:
- Principal (100,000 ETH) remains intact
- Only staking rewards are distributed
- Creates perpetual funding stream
- User choice between donation and claim

## Key Projects Funded

Notable recipients include:
- Ethereum infrastructure projects
- Developer tooling
- Research and education
- Community initiatives
