## Background

Optimism's third RetroPGF round in January 2024 was the largest retroactive funding experiment in crypto history. With 30M OP tokens (~$90M at distribution) allocated to reward past contributions to the Optimism Collective.

## The Mechanism

RetroPGF 3 used badgeholders (trusted community members) to evaluate and vote on nominated projects across four categories:
- OP Stack contributions
- Collective governance
- Developer ecosystem
- End user experience & adoption

**146 badgeholders** evaluated **644 nominated projects**, ultimately funding 501.

## Scale Challenges

The round faced significant scaling challenges:
- Review burden on badgeholders was substantial
- Cross-category comparison proved difficult
- Some projects optimized for voting vs. actual impact
- Evaluation consistency varied across badgeholders

## Outcomes

**501 projects received funding**, with distribution ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of OP tokens.

Top allocations went to:
- Core infrastructure and tooling
- Governance contributions
- Developer experience improvements
- End-user applications

## Lessons Learned

1. **Impact measurement is hard**: Comparing a governance tool to a DeFi protocol requires nuanced evaluation
2. **Badgeholder bandwidth**: 644 projects is too many for thorough evaluation
3. **Gaming concerns**: Some applicants optimized profiles for votes rather than demonstrating real impact
4. **Positive incentives**: Despite challenges, RetroPGF creates strong incentives for future builders
