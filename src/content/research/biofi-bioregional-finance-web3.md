## What is a Bioregion?

A bioregion is a naturally defined region — shaped by watersheds, soil types, plant life, animal migration, and Indigenous cultures. Unlike political borders, bioregions follow the logic of ecosystems. Think "Salmon Nation" in the Pacific Northwest, or the Amazon headwaters. Bioregionalism is about aligning human systems with the patterns of nature.

## What is BioFi?

BioFi (Bioregional Finance) is a real-world use case for web3 that channels capital into regenerating the planet. It's about routing resources away from extractive finance and toward local communities stewarding ecosystems, culture, and place.

Billions in climate and ESG funds get lost in top-down infrastructure. Meanwhile, the people actually restoring land, water, and culture — Indigenous nations, regenerative farms, permaculture guilds — are often invisible to capital.

BioFi flips the model. Using DAOs, eco-credits, quadratic voting, and tokenized funding flows, BioFi helps communities become their own capital allocators — grounded in bioregional identity and ecological intelligence.

## What are Bioregional Financing Facilities?

Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs) are modular, local-first capital networks designed to:

- Fund regenerative work at the pace of trust
- Bridge crypto-native tools with real-world coordination
- Aggregate portfolios of projects rooted in land, culture, and community

They combine pieces like:

- **A Bioregional Trust** — grant pool
- **A Venture Studio** — early-stage regenerative orgs
- **An Investment Company** — fund or bond structure
- **A Bioregional Bank** — low-interest loans, local currencies

Each BFF is custom-fit to its region. Some may start as a DAO. Others may be hosted by a land trust. The point is: coordination tech meets biocultural reality.

## Case Studies

BioFi isn't just theory. It's already happening:

- **Regen Network:** Tokenized eco-credits and staking models for ecological state changes, with projects in Latin America and the Pacific Northwest.
- **Golden Bay, New Zealand:** Piloting participatory grantmaking with quadratic and conviction voting.
- **Salmon Nation:** A bioregion-wide trust and studio incubating regenerative entrepreneurs across Cascadia.
- **Spruce Root (Alaska):** Indigenous-led CDFI combining local capital with regenerative development.
- **Regenerate Cascadia:** Multistakeholder DAO-style coordination across 75+ ecoregions in the Pacific Northwest.
- **Hylo:** Coordination layer for regenerative networks, with DAO integrations in development.
- **ReCommon:** Prototyping bioregional land trusts and common asset governance frameworks.
- **Regenerosity:** Flowing philanthropic capital to grassroots regeneration through trust-based grantmaking.

## Why It Matters

Web3 has struggled to prove it matters beyond speculation. BioFi is different: it's a route to mass adoption grounded in legitimacy, culture, and shared survival.

It turns coordination tech into public infrastructure. It invites capital to become less extractive, more relational. And it lets crypto align with the most important use case of all: regenerating Earth.
