## Executive Summary

The Ethereum ecosystem distributed over $500M to public goods in 2024 through various mechanisms. This report analyzes the landscape, trends, and opportunities.

## Key Findings

### Capital Flows by Mechanism

Estimated public goods funding in 2024:
- **Retroactive Funding**: ~$150M (Optimism RetroPGF 5 & 6, OP Stack incentives)
- **Quadratic Funding**: ~$50M (Gitcoin rounds, clr.fund, Octant)
- **Direct Grants**: ~$200M (EF ESP, Arbitrum LTIP, protocol treasuries)
- **Streaming**: ~$50M (Protocol Guild distributions)
- **DAO Treasuries**: ~$50M (Nouns, ENS, other DAOs)

### Mechanism Trends

1. **Retroactive funding maturing**: Optimism's RetroPGF has become a major force, with rounds 5 and 6 distributing over 10M OP tokens
2. **QF decentralizing**: Community rounds expanding beyond Gitcoin core with 15+ independent rounds per season
3. **Streaming gaining traction**: Protocol Guild's $92.9M success inspiring adoption
4. **Hybrid approaches emerging**: Combining mechanisms for different needs

### Notable Programs

- **Protocol Guild**: $92.9M+ pledged for 187 core devs
- **Optimism RetroPGF**: 100M+ OP distributed across all rounds
- **Arbitrum Incentives**: 117M+ ARB through STIP and LTIP
- **Gitcoin Grants**: $60M+ total since 2019

## Recommendations

1. More investment in impact measurement infrastructure
2. Better coordination between major funders
3. Focus on sustainability beyond one-time grants
4. Support for mechanism research and experimentation
