**Dedicated Domain Allocation (DDA)** is a decentralized funding framework that distributes capital allocation authority to trusted specialists — domain stewards — rather than centralizing decisions in a single committee. Each steward manages funding within a clearly defined area like DevRel, Governance, Ecosystem, or Research.

## How It Works

Rather than routing all funding decisions through one body, DDA creates parallel decision-making structures staffed by subject-matter experts.

1. **Define domains** — the ecosystem identifies distinct funding areas (e.g., Dev Tools, Governance, Research, Community)
2. **Appoint stewards** — experienced individuals with relevant expertise and community credibility are selected for each domain
3. **Allocate capital pools** — each domain receives a dedicated budget from the treasury
4. **Stewards evaluate and fund** — within their mandate, stewards source, evaluate, and approve grants independently
5. **Assess performance** — each domain's impact is independently assessed based on transparency and outcome metrics

## Advantages

- Matches expert knowledge to allocation decisions — stewards understand what's needed in their domain
- Enables simultaneous funding rounds across multiple domains without bottlenecks
- Enhances accountability — each domain's performance can be independently assessed
- Eliminates centralized decision-making bottlenecks

## Limitations

- May introduce unnecessary complexity in small communities
- Requires clear consensus on who holds decision-making authority
- Struggles with cross-domain or ad-hoc projects that don't fit neatly into one area
- Risk of siloed thinking — domains may optimize locally rather than for the ecosystem

## Best Used When

- Large or expanding ecosystems with multiple distinct focus areas
- DAOs with enough scale to justify specialized stewardship
- Protocol treasuries needing structured, accountable allocation
- Organizations seeking decentralized yet aligned governance

## Examples and Use Cases

### Protocol Treasury Delegation
A protocol treasury delegates authority to four stewards managing Dev Tools, Governance, Ecosystem, and Research. Each steward runs their own evaluation process and reports outcomes to the broader community.

### Rotating Steward Models
Communities rotate stewards periodically, onboarding new decision-makers per domain to prevent capture and bring fresh perspectives.

### Bioregional Networks
Bioregional funding networks distribute capital through locally-accountable stewards who understand regional needs and contexts.
