**Decentralized Validators** are trusted, independent participants who review, verify, or endorse actions within funding systems. Rather than centralizing decision-making, this model distributes verification power across multiple validators to enhance trust and minimize bias.

## How It Works

Decentralized Validators add a distributed trust layer to funding mechanisms.

1. **Define validator roles** — clear responsibilities (proposal approval, milestone verification, eligibility confirmation, impact evaluation)
2. **Select validators** — through delegation, staking, random assignment, or reputation mechanisms
3. **Validators review and attest** — independently evaluating proposals, milestones, or contributions
4. **Incentivize participation** — validators receive governance rights, reputation enhancements, or fee shares
5. **Aggregate decisions** — multiple validator assessments are combined to reach funding decisions

## Advantages

- Creates legitimacy without central gatekeeping
- Scales review capacity across many independent reviewers
- Adds trust layers for complex, high-stakes funding decisions
- Enables composable evaluation workflows

## Limitations

- Adds overhead for small-scale systems where a single reviewer would suffice
- Requires sufficient trust in the validator selection process itself
- Struggles with tasks needing extensive context or domain expertise
- Incompatible with speed-prioritized models where quick decisions matter

## Best Used When

- High-value or high-volume grant programs need distributed review
- Milestone-based grants require independent verification of deliverables
- Retroactive funding needs impact evaluation from multiple perspectives
- Identity or reputation-dependent participation needs verification infrastructure

## Examples and Use Cases

### Gitcoin Passport
Distributed verification of user identity and humanity scores, feeding into sybil resistance for quadratic funding rounds.

### Optimism RetroPGF Reviewers
Independent reviewers evaluate impact claims from projects seeking retroactive funding, distributing evaluation across many perspectives.

### Milestone Verification
Grant programs use decentralized validators to independently confirm that funded projects have delivered on their milestones before releasing subsequent tranches.
