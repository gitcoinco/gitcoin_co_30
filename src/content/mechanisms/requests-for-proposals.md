**Requests for Proposals (RFPs)** are a formal capital allocation mechanism adapted from traditional procurement. An organization defines a specific problem or need, publishes detailed requirements and success criteria, and invites external teams to submit competing proposals. The best-fit proposal is selected through structured evaluation.

## How It Works

RFPs create a structured, competitive process for matching needs with solutions.

1. **Define the need** — the organization documents the problem, requirements, objectives, success criteria, budget, and timeline
2. **Publish the RFP** — the document is shared publicly, inviting qualified teams to respond
3. **Teams submit proposals** — respondents detail their approach, qualifications, timeline, and budget
4. **Evaluate against criteria** — a review committee scores proposals against predefined criteria
5. **Select and contract** — the winning team is selected, terms are negotiated, and work begins
6. **Execute and track** — project execution is monitored against milestones and deliverables

## Advantages

- Solicits high-quality responses to specific, complex needs
- Encourages multiple approaches to defined goals, surfacing creative solutions
- Creates accountability through scoped contracts and deliverables
- Well-understood format that attracts professional teams

## Limitations

- Cannot surface grassroots innovation or unknown opportunities
- Poorly suited for fast-track, low-governance funding
- Not designed for early-stage or emergent ideas that can't yet be specified
- Requires significant time and capacity to manage the multi-step process

## Best Used When

- Complex technical scopes need precise solutions (protocol upgrades, security audits, tooling)
- Organizations want competitive bidding across qualified teams
- Projects require detailed review, milestone-based accountability, and structured delivery
- The need is well-defined enough to specify in advance

## Examples and Use Cases
