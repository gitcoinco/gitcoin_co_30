**Guilds** are organized subgroups within DAOs and Web3 ecosystems that receive allocated funding to support contributors specializing in particular domains. Like departments with decentralized authority, each guild has a defined mandate, internal governance, and funding to coordinate work in its area — infrastructure, events, governance, content, or research.

## How It Works

Guilds create structured, autonomous units within larger organizations.

1. **Define guild scope** — each guild has a clear mandate aligned with specific work (dev tools, events, governance, content)
2. **Recruit members** — contributors with relevant expertise or demonstrated interest join the guild
3. **Allocate funding** — guilds receive budgets from central treasuries or generate independent revenue
4. **Internal governance** — guilds manage their own coordination using voting, bounties, proposals, or shared budgets
5. **Track and distribute** — contributions are tracked and rewards distributed through internal mechanisms

## Advantages

- Establishes clear contributor work categories and accountability
- Allocates funds based on specialized roles and domain expertise
- Fosters shared culture and identity within functional areas
- Creates structured onboarding pathways for new contributors

## Limitations

- Not suited for ad-hoc funding that crosses domain boundaries
- Requires enough functional specialization to justify separate units
- Can create siloed thinking if inter-guild communication is weak
- Premature complexity for nascent communities that haven't yet found their shape

## Best Used When

- Protocol DAOs have distinct workstreams that benefit from specialized teams
- Public goods ecosystems need to support diverse contributor types
- Networks want to give contributors autonomy within defined domains
- Organizations need enduring functional teams with their own governance

## Examples and Use Cases

### Dev Guild
A Dev Guild distributes quarterly funding through internal contributor proposals for protocol development, tooling, and infrastructure maintenance.

### Governance Guild
A Governance Guild manages onboarding for new delegates, policy development, and forum moderation — funded from the DAO treasury.

### Regional Guild
A Latin America Guild executes DAO-funded localization, events, and community building for the Spanish-speaking ecosystem.
