**Evolutionary Grants Games** treat funding like a living system. Instead of a one-time grant process, proposals emerge, mutate, and compete across iterative rounds. Community members act as selectors through signaling, remixing, and voting — borrowing from biological evolution and competitive dynamics to surface the strongest ideas.

## How It Works

The mechanism replaces static grant applications with an evolving ecosystem of proposals.

1. **Proposals are submitted** as initial "organisms" in the first generation
2. **Community evaluates** using fitness functions — metrics like impact scores, votes, and community backing
3. **Underperforming proposals are eliminated** based on clear survival rules
4. **Surviving proposals can mutate and recombine** — authors edit, remix, or merge proposals based on feedback
5. **New generations repeat** the cycle (e.g., monthly), with each round producing stronger, more adapted proposals
6. **Funding flows to the fittest** — proposals that consistently demonstrate community support and impact receive capital

## Advantages

- Rewards adaptive, evolving proposals over static applications
- Surfaces unexpected, emerging ideas that wouldn't survive traditional review
- Deepens community participation beyond simple voting
- Allocates resources based on demonstrated fitness rather than initial hype

## Limitations

- Not suited for low-engagement environments where participation is sparse
- Poorly suited for urgent, one-off funding needs
- Projects requiring predictable upfront capital may not fit the iterative model
- Communities resistant to experimental processes may reject the format

## Best Used When

- Experimental ecosystems want to discover novel approaches through iteration
- Innovation funding where the best ideas aren't yet known
- Engaged communities willing to participate across multiple rounds
- Long-term development pipelines focused on continuous improvement

## Examples and Use Cases

### Monthly Evolution Cycles
A public goods ecosystem runs monthly submission cycles where top ideas evolve and continue into the next round, with each generation getting sharper through community feedback.

### Fork-and-Combine Platforms
Platforms allow contributors to fork existing proposals, combine elements from multiple submissions, and create hybrid approaches that inherit the best traits.

### Long-Term Adaptive Grants
Grants grow iteratively with feedback-responsive resource allocation — starting small and scaling funding as proposals demonstrate fitness over multiple generations.
