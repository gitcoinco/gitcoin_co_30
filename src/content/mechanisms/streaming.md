**Category:** Streaming
**Origin Year:** 2020

Token streaming enables continuous, real-time transfer of tokens. Instead of lump sum payments, funds flow constantly from sender to recipient at a defined rate per second.

This enables new financial primitives like real-time salary payments, continuous subscriptions, and streaming grants. Recipients can access their earned funds at any moment, improving cash flow and reducing trust requirements.

Protocols like Superfluid and Drips have pioneered this approach.

## How It Works

1. Sender creates a stream with token and flow rate
2. Tokens continuously transfer in real-time
3. Recipient can withdraw accumulated funds anytime
4. Stream continues until stopped or funds depleted
5. Can be combined with other DeFi primitives

## Advantages

- Improved cash flow for recipients
- Real-time compensation
- Reduced counterparty risk
- Composable with DeFi
- Automatic, requires no manual transactions

## Limitations

- Requires consistent sender balance
- Gas costs for modifications
- Complex accounting
- Limited to compatible tokens
- Learning curve for users

## Best Used For

- Ongoing salaries and compensation
- Subscription services
- Continuous grants
- Vesting schedules
