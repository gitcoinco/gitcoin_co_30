Milestone-based funding releases capital in stages as projects complete agreed-upon deliverables. This approach balances the needs of funders (reduced risk, accountability) with grantees (sufficient capital to execute).

It's particularly common in larger grants where the funder wants to ensure progress before releasing additional funds. Smart contracts can automate milestone verification and fund release.

## How It Works

1. Project and funder agree on milestones and amounts
2. Initial tranche released to start work
3. Project completes and reports on milestone
4. Evaluator verifies completion
5. Next tranche released, process repeats

## Advantages

- Reduces funder risk
- Ensures accountability
- Provides clear checkpoints
- Aligns incentives
- Can be automated with smart contracts

## Limitations

- Milestone definition is challenging
- Less flexible for exploratory work
- Administrative overhead
- Can slow down fast-moving projects
- Evaluation bottlenecks

## Best Used For

- Large development projects
- Infrastructure builds
- Long-term initiatives
- Higher-risk projects
