Milestone-based funding releases capital in stages as projects complete agreed-upon deliverables. This approach balances the needs of funders (reduced risk, accountability) with grantees (sufficient capital to execute).

It's particularly common in larger grants where the funder wants to ensure progress before releasing additional funds. Smart contracts can automate milestone verification and fund release.
