**Cookie Jar** is a micro-grants mechanism that lets trusted community contributors draw modest amounts from a shared pool without extensive oversight. Small contributions — answering questions, organizing events, building tools — merit real financial support but shouldn't require burdensome grant processes.

## How It Works

The Cookie Jar operates on mutual accountability and pre-established trust.

1. **Establish a shared pool** — a community funds a Cookie Jar with a defined budget
2. **Designate trusted members** — "cookie holders" are community members recognized as active contributors
3. **Set withdrawal limits** — each holder can withdraw capped amounts at regulated intervals (e.g., $100/week)
4. **Members self-serve** — when a cookie holder does useful work, they withdraw from the jar without requiring approval
5. **Community oversight** — withdrawals are transparent, and the community monitors for misuse through social accountability

## Advantages

- Minimizes administrative burden for tiny allocations
- Supports continuous, low-stakes contributions in real time
- Functions within high-trust settings without governance overhead
- Acknowledges helpful conduct without procedural friction

## Limitations

- Requires established trustworthiness among participants
- Only works with predetermined spending limits and contained financial risk
- Unsuitable for substantial projects or large allocations
- Falters among untrusting parties or when rigorous milestone verification is needed

## Best Used When

- Community organizers handle recurring modest tasks (event coordination, content creation, community calls)
- Emerging DAOs have active stewards doing small but valuable work
- Open source projects want to reward peer assistance and micro-contributions
- Public goods groups need to fund micro-actions without committee review

## Examples and Use Cases

### DAO Contributor Petty Cash
A DAO sets up a Cookie Jar with $2,000/month. Trusted contributors withdraw small amounts for community calls, documentation fixes, and Discord moderation without filing grant applications.

### Open Source Micro-Rewards
An open source project lets recognized contributors pull $50-$100 for reviewing PRs, answering issues, and writing tutorials.
