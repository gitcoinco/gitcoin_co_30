**Harberger Taxes** create a system of temporary ownership where asset holders must declare a sale price, pay recurring taxes on that value, and sell to anyone offering the declared price. This prevents monopolization of scarce resources, incentivizes honest valuation, and generates tax revenue for public goods.

## How It Works

Harberger Taxes create a self-correcting ownership system that balances private use with public benefit.

1. **Self-assessment** — the asset owner declares what price they'd accept for the asset
2. **Taxation** — the owner pays recurring taxes based on their declared valuation (higher declared value = higher taxes)
3. **Forced sale** — anyone can purchase the asset at the owner's declared price at any time
4. **Revenue flows to public goods** — tax revenue supports community treasuries or common funds
5. **Honest pricing incentive** — underpricing means losing the asset cheaply; overpricing means paying excessive taxes

## Advantages

- Prevents monopolization and hoarding of scarce resources
- Incentivizes accurate, honest valuation through economic pressure
- Generates continuous revenue for public goods from private asset use
- Keeps valuable assets actively utilized rather than idle
- Links private control to community benefit

## Limitations

- Incompatible with assets requiring stable long-term ownership (personal identity, primary residence)
- Communities may resist forced sales or price volatility
- Requires robust smart contract infrastructure and compliance mechanisms
- Struggles with highly speculative or illiquid assets

## Best Used When

- Domain or handle ownership (ENS, Lens protocols) needs to prevent squatting
- Governance rights or delegate seats should be contestable
- Digital land and metaverse plots should remain productively used
- Communities want to prevent passive rent-seeking while funding public goods

## Examples and Use Cases

### ENS Domain Management
ENS domains under Harberger taxation prevent name squatting — if you hold a valuable domain, you either use it and pay the tax, or someone who values it more buys it from you.

### Contestable Governance Seats
Delegate seats in a DAO are Harberger-taxed — delegates must declare a price for their seat, pay taxes to the treasury, and can be bought out by challengers who are willing to pay more.

### Digital Land Allocation
Metaverse plots under Harberger taxation ensure productive use — idle land becomes expensive to hold, freeing it for active builders.
