**Bounties** are a task-based funding mechanism where a funder defines a task, sets a reward, and contributors claim the bounty by completing the work. It's a straightforward "you do this, you get that" model emphasizing speed, clarity, and minimal friction.

## How It Works

Bounties create a direct link between defined work and compensation.

1. **Define the task** — a funder specifies clear deliverables, scope, acceptance criteria, and reward amount
2. **Post the bounty** — published on forums, bounty platforms (Dework, Gitcoin), or via smart contracts
3. **Contributors claim and execute** — one or more contributors pick up the work and deliver results
4. **Review and accept** — a reviewer evaluates the submission against acceptance criteria
5. **Payment releases** — upon acceptance, the reward is released (optionally via smart contract escrow for trustless payment)

## Advantages

- Reduces friction between funders and contributors to near zero
- Creates execution-focused incentives with clear expectations
- Attracts talent through accessible, low-commitment entry points
- Distributes work across decentralized networks efficiently

## Limitations

- Struggles with complex or collaborative projects requiring sustained coordination
- Not suited for long-term relationship building
- Poorly handles ambiguous or evolving requirements
- Requires clear scope — if the task can't be well-defined, bounties won't work

## Best Used When

- Scoped, measurable deliverables in design, development, research, or content
- Fast-paced funding requiring minimal governance overhead
- New contributor onboarding through low-commitment opportunities
- Execution-heavy tasks where scope is clearly defined and outcomes are verifiable

## Examples and Use Cases

### Bug Fixes and Documentation
Public goods networks use bounties for bug fixes, documentation improvements, and UX research — work that's well-scoped and independently completable.

### Translation and Localization
Community labs fund multi-language resource translations via bounties, allowing contributors worldwide to participate.

### Design and Graphics
DAOs issue bounties for protocol explanatory graphics, social media assets, and UI/UX improvements.
