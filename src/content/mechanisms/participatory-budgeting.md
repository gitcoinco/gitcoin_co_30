**Participatory Budgeting (PB)** allows communities to decide together how to spend money. It shifts resource allocation authority from centralized decision-makers to the people impacted by funding choices. Originally developed in Porto Alegre, Brazil, PB has expanded globally across civic, institutional, and blockchain contexts.

## How It Works

PB follows a structured cycle from proposal to accountability.

1. **Community members submit proposals** for how shared funds should be spent
2. **Deliberation and review** — participants discuss, refine, and evaluate proposals collectively
3. **Voting** — the community votes using various mechanisms (one-person-one-vote, quadratic voting, STAR voting)
4. **Funds allocate** based on voting outcomes and budget limits
5. **Accountability** — funded projects report on execution and impact

## Advantages

- Empowers community voice in resource allocation
- Makes resource distribution transparent and participatory
- Aligns spending with real community needs and experiences
- Encourages deliberation, not just voting

## Limitations

- Struggles with funding specialized technical work requiring expertise
- Low-engagement or apathetic communities may produce unrepresentative results
- Time-sensitive decisions may not fit the deliberative cycle
- Unequal participation can skew outcomes toward vocal minorities

## Best Used When

- Active DAOs want decentralized budgeting for treasury funds
- Regional Web3 communities need to coordinate public goods spending
- Civic tech networks experiment with blockchain-enabled governance
- Organizations are committed to grassroots, bottom-up economics

## Examples and Use Cases

### Bioregional DAO Allocation
A bioregional DAO allocates $50k for community gardens, workshops, and local infrastructure through participatory budgeting, with residents voting on proposals.

### Protocol Treasury Delegation
Protocol treasuries delegate budget rounds to the community using quadratic voting to determine allocations.

### Impact DAO Coalition
Impact DAO coalitions pool matching funds across regenerative finance initiatives, with participating communities voting on priorities.
