**Quadratic Acceleration (q/acc)** merges Quadratic Funding's democratic allocation with Augmented Bonding Curves' economic sustainability. Contributors fund public goods projects via QF, and projects receive not only capital but curve-based tokens — turning public goods into programmable economic primitives.

## How It Works

q/acc layers continuous economic sustainability on top of democratic capital allocation.

1. **Quadratic Funding round runs** — the community allocates resources based on the number and breadth of contributions (many small donations > few large ones)
2. **Projects receive bonding curve positions** — instead of just one-time grants, funded projects receive positions on Augmented Bonding Curves
3. **Tokens represent long-term value** — projects can mint or redeem tokens representing long-term economic claims
4. **Secondary markets form** — tokens can be traded, creating ongoing price discovery and liquidity for public goods
5. **Mutual investment dynamics** — funders and builders both benefit from upside as projects grow

## Advantages

- Funds impactful work through democratic processes (QF) while providing economic sustainability (bonding curves)
- Creates mutual investment dynamics where funders and builders share upside
- Bridges one-time grant funding with continuous coordination mechanisms
- Enables communities to co-own the success of projects they support

## Limitations

- Not suited for simple, single-round funding where a one-time grant suffices
- Requires engaged, high-trust communities with token literacy
- Demands bonding curve infrastructure and token engineering expertise
- Unnecessary for projects that don't need long-term economic sustainability

## Best Used When

- Token-engineering and regenerative-focused DAOs want shared ownership models
- Communities want to fund public goods and maintain ongoing economic alignment with funded projects
- Funding experiments need both democratic legitimacy and long-term liquidity
- Teams are building economic coordination systems beyond one-time grants

## Examples and Use Cases

### QF + Bonding Curve Integration
DAOs run QF rounds where funded projects then launch bonding curves — contributors can trade their positions, creating ongoing price discovery for public goods.

### Tokenized Ecosystem Infrastructure
ReFi communities issue tokenized positions in ecosystem infrastructure, allowing contributors to hold economic stakes in the tools they fund.

### Commons Working Groups
Commons networks bootstrap working groups with capital plus governance tokens, creating alignment between funders and builders.
