**Gift Circles** are participatory funding gatherings where a group of people comes together to discuss needs, contributions, and intentions, then collectively decides how to allocate a shared pool of funds or support. Rather than traditional voting or competitive pitching, participants engage in listening, witnessing, and gifting with relational awareness.

## How It Works

Gift Circles replace competitive grant processes with relational, dialogue-based allocation.

1. **Gather participants** — a group with shared context and mutual trust assembles (in-person or online)
2. **Pool resources** — a shared funding pool is established for the session
3. **Structured sharing rounds** — each participant shares their needs, contributions, and intentions with the group
4. **Collective gifting** — the group collectively decides how to distribute funds based on what was shared, often through consensus or facilitated dialogue
5. **Full transparency** — all allocation decisions are visible to the group

## Advantages

- Builds deep trust and presence in funding decisions
- Surfaces invisible or relational labor (care work, stewardship, emotional support)
- Creates shared ownership of allocation decisions
- Supports collective emotional and economic resilience

## Limitations

- Does not scale to large, anonymous groups
- Unsuitable for rapid decision-making or efficiency-focused funding
- Poorly suited for competitive or adversarial contexts
- Requires emotional safety and trust among participants

## Best Used When

- Tight-knit, values-aligned communities need to distribute funds
- Recognizing care work and emotional labor that other mechanisms miss
- Cultural and ritual-based public goods funding
- Small to medium distributions where relational trust is high

## Examples and Use Cases

### DAO Contributor Care Budgets
DAOs distribute monthly contributor care budgets through gratitude-based gifting circles, recognizing work that falls outside formal deliverables.

### Local ReFi Hub Allocation
A local ReFi hub allocates $5,000 across stewards, artists, and organizers through a facilitated gift circle, honoring contributions that would be invisible in a standard grant process.

### Seasonal Cultural Commons
Communities combine resource allocation with ritual, storytelling, and presence in seasonal circles that fund cultural infrastructure.
