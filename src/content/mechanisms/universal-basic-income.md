**Universal Basic Income (UBI)** distributes a flat amount of income to everyone in a defined group or network — regularly, without conditions. The goal is decoupling survival from labor, enabling broader participation in public goods, creativity, and care work.

## How It Works

UBI creates a baseline economic floor for all participants in a community or protocol.

1. **Define eligibility** — universal (everyone), verified humans (Proof of Humanity, BrightID), or specific community members
2. **Establish funding source** — protocol revenue, treasury inflation, donations, or tax mechanisms
3. **Set distribution frequency** — monthly batches, daily distributions, or continuous streaming (via Superfluid, Sablier)
4. **Automate disbursement** — smart contracts distribute funds to all eligible participants without conditions
5. **Recipients participate freely** — with basic economic security, participants can contribute to public goods, care work, or creative endeavors without survival pressure

## Advantages

- Establishes economic security as foundational infrastructure
- Eliminates gatekeeping and conditional funding barriers
- Fosters intrinsic motivation and diverse ecosystem participation
- Cultivates shared identity through collective wealth-building

## Limitations

- Cannot fund capital-intensive projects — UBI provides a floor, not project budgets
- Not suited for performance-based or targeted rewards
- Vulnerable to sybil attacks in high-risk environments without robust identity verification
- Doesn't replace milestone-dependent grant scenarios

## Best Used When

- A protocol or DAO has recurring revenue and wants to share it unconditionally
- Addressing economic inequality and precarity within a community
- Enabling participation in public goods ecosystems for people who couldn't otherwise afford to contribute
- Experimenting with post-scarcity economic models

## Examples and Use Cases

### Proof of Humanity UBI
Proof of Humanity streams UBI tokens to verified individuals, creating a baseline income for anyone who can prove they're a unique human.

### Protocol Fee Distribution
Protocols allocate a percentage of transaction fees (e.g., 5%) to all ecosystem participants as unconditional income.

### Community Currency UBI
Community DAOs distribute basic income in local currencies, enabling regional commerce and participation without fiat dependency.
