**Impact Certificates (Hypercerts)** are onchain tokens representing completed impactful work. They flip the funding model: instead of paying for promises, they let contributors create verifiable claims about what they've already done. Hypercerts, developed by Protocol Labs and the Hypercerts Foundation, provide a standardized, open-source format including who did what, for whom, when, and what impact was created.

## How It Works

Impact Certificates create a market for verified public goods contributions.

1. **Work is completed** — a contributor or project delivers impact to the ecosystem
2. **A Hypercert is minted** — an onchain token is created documenting the work: who, what, for whom, when, and impact claims
3. **Evaluation and verification** — trusted evaluators, marketplaces, or community input validate the impact claims
4. **Funding flows retroactively** — retroactive funding rounds, impact investors, or communities purchase or fund verified Hypercerts
5. **Trade and curation** — Hypercerts can be fractionalized, traded, and curated, creating a secondary market for impact

## Advantages

- Enables funding after impact is created, reducing speculative risk
- Creates transparent, onchain records of contribution attribution
- Aligns funding with verified outcomes rather than promises
- Allows trade, speculation, and curation of impactful work

## Limitations

- Unsuitable for upfront funding needs — only works retroactively
- Challenging when impact is difficult to define, measure, or verify
- Ineffective in low-trust environments without established evaluation norms
- Can be excessively complex for simple, one-off grants

## Best Used When

- DAOs or foundations run retroactive funding programs
- Contributors need recognition and compensation beyond initial payments
- Public goods funders prioritize attribution, transparency, and verified impact
- Builders are experimenting with impact marketplaces and retroactive economics

## Examples and Use Cases

### RetroPGF Integration
Contributors mint Hypercerts for community work — documentation, mentorship, tool building — which are later funded through retroactive public goods rounds.

### Impact Investment
Impact funds purchase certificates from multiple open-source contributors, creating a portfolio of verified public goods work.

### Cross-Ecosystem Attribution
Public goods coalitions track work across ecosystems using Hypercerts as a shared attribution standard, building reputation ledgers that span communities.
