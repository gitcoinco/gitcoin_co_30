Attestation-based funding uses onchain attestations — verifiable, cryptographic claims about identity, actions, or impact — to inform how funding is allocated. Instead of relying solely on applications, votes, or committee judgment, funding mechanisms reference attestations as objective signals. These signals can gate participation, weight influence, or directly trigger payouts.

In the funding stack, attestation-based funding operates at the attribution layer. It does not replace allocation mechanisms like quadratic funding or retroactive funding; it strengthens them by supplying reusable, verifiable signals about identity, contribution, and impact.
