**STAR Voting** (Score Then Automatic Runoff) is a voting mechanism where participants rate each option on a scale (typically 0-5 stars), the two highest-scoring options advance to a runoff, and whichever gains majority preference wins. It combines the expressiveness of scoring with the decisiveness of a runoff.

## How It Works

STAR Voting unfolds in two stages that balance nuance with decisiveness.

1. **Scoring phase** — voters rate each option on a 0-5 scale, expressing intensity of support
2. **Scores are totaled** — the two options with the highest aggregate scores advance to the runoff
3. **Automatic runoff** — between the top two, the option preferred by a majority of voters wins
4. **Result** — the winner is both well-liked (high score) and broadly supported (majority preference)

## Advantages

- Avoids vote-splitting — supporters of similar options don't undermine each other
- Encourages honest voting by letting voters express genuine intensity of support
- Produces winners that are both well-liked and broadly supported
- Enables nuanced differentiation across many options

## Limitations

- Not designed for funding multiple options simultaneously
- Challenging in real-time or continuous voting environments
- Poor fit for scenarios requiring proportional representation
- Can produce distorted results with very low participation

## Best Used When

- DAOs need to select a single proposal, leader, or direction from many options
- Communities want expressive governance that captures intensity of preference
- Ecosystems are experimenting with post-binary voting systems
- Single-winner scenarios where both support breadth and depth matter

## Examples and Use Cases

### Flagship Proposal Selection
A DAO uses STAR Voting to select its next flagship initiative from ten proposals — voters score each, and the final two face a runoff.

### Steward Election
Communities elect stewards using STAR Voting, ensuring the winner has both high individual approval and majority support against the runner-up.

### Grant Priority Setting
Grant programs use STAR Voting to determine which funding categories to prioritize in the next cycle.
