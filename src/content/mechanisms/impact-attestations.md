**Impact Attestations** are social or onchain signals that say: this person or project made a valuable contribution. They function as a legitimacy layer without requiring tokens or money, feeding into downstream funding mechanisms like Retro Funding, Hypercerts, or Allo registries.

## How It Works

Impact Attestations create a reputational substrate that other funding mechanisms can build on.

1. **Contributions are made** — a person or project delivers value to the ecosystem
2. **Attestations are issued** by peers, steward councils, smart contracts, or networks — vouching for the contribution's value
3. **Attestations accumulate** into reputational capital — onchain or offchain, transferable or soulbound, quantitative or qualitative
4. **Downstream mechanisms consume attestations** — retroactive funding rounds, registries, and grant programs use attestation data as input for allocation decisions
5. **Reputation compounds** over time, creating a track record that informs future funding

## Advantages

- Creates lightweight, verifiable recognition without requiring direct funding
- Supports decentralized legitimacy building from the bottom up
- Enables bottom-up value signaling that feeds into top-down allocation
- Composable with funding, identity, and governance systems

## Limitations

- Cannot replace direct funding — attestations are signals, not capital
- Inadequate for precise metrics or KPIs
- Ineffective without shared values or trust in the attesting community
- Requires integration with follow-on systems to translate into funding

## Best Used When

- DAOs need to capture reputation over time across contributors
- Grant programs want to honor non-winners or recognize ongoing contributions
- Communities are building decentralized registries of legitimate actors
- Public goods ecosystems need post-token legitimacy infrastructure

## Examples and Use Cases

### Peer Attestations for Mentorship
Contributors receive peer attestations for mentorship, community support, and knowledge sharing — work that rarely shows up in formal deliverables.

### RetroPGF Input Layer
Retroactive funding rounds incorporate community attestations as one signal among many when determining impact and allocating rewards.

### Trust Mapping for Future Funding
Networks build attestation-based trust maps that inform future funding decisions — projects with strong attestation histories receive priority consideration.
