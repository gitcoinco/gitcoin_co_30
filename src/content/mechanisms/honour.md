**Honour** is a coordination mechanism that surfaces non-financial forms of value — care, reliability, relational trust, and integrity. Rather than distributing funds or votes, participants publicly recognize one another's contributions, creating a social ledger of what the community values.

## How It Works

Honour creates a recognition layer that can exist independently or feed into financial mechanisms.

1. **Contributions are observed** — community members notice care work, stewardship, reliability, and other undervalued labor
2. **Recognition is issued** — through thank-you tokens, public endorsements, onchain attestations, badges, or non-transferable NFTs
3. **Signals accumulate** — over time, recognized contributors build a visible track record of community value
4. **Optional downstream effects** — honour signals can feed into funding decisions (filtering registries, seeding retroactive rounds) or stand alone as legitimacy infrastructure

## Advantages

- Surfaces overlooked or underappreciated work that financial mechanisms miss
- Reinforces cultural cohesion and shared identity
- Reduces dependence on financial incentives for motivation
- Establishes community narrative around shared values

## Limitations

- Not suited for direct capital allocation — honour is recognition, not money
- Cannot replace systems requiring measurable accountability
- Requires strong social bonds to feel meaningful rather than performative
- Not effective in high-stakes funding disputes

## Best Used When

- Public goods communities want to recognize care and stewardship work
- DAOs need to honor contributions that don't fit into financial reward structures
- Long-term trust-building initiatives need visible, low-cost recognition
- Communities want to create legitimacy infrastructure that feeds into future funding

## Examples and Use Cases

### Crisis Support Recognition
Communities mint Honour badges for contributors who provided emotional support during ecosystem crises — work that's invisible in any grant report.

### Ceremonial Steward Recognition
DAO stewards receive non-transferable NFTs through ceremonial recognition events, creating visible proof of service.

### Funding Eligibility Signals
Public goods ecosystems use accumulated Honour attestations as one factor in determining future funding eligibility.
