**Artizen Artifacts** are non-financial tokens of recognition awarded to people who contribute meaningfully to public goods and cultural ecosystems. They function as collectible proofs of impact — onchain objects that represent not just what was done, but why it mattered. Developed by the Artizen community, they represent a post-financial reward layer.

## How It Works

Artizen Artifacts encode cultural and symbolic value into onchain objects.

1. **Contributions are identified** — meaningful work in public goods, culture, art, or community is recognized
2. **Artifacts are curated** — a selection or curation process determines who receives recognition
3. **Onchain minting** — artifacts are minted as NFTs with embedded media, art, or poetic metadata
4. **Distribution** — artifacts are awarded at the end of funding rounds, community ceremonies, or milestone events
5. **Optional downstream effects** — artifacts may serve as access passes, eligibility criteria, or reputation signals for future opportunities

## Advantages

- Encodes legitimacy and impact symbolically in lasting onchain objects
- Honors contributions that traditional funding mechanisms overlook
- Strengthens community memory and identity
- Makes onchain coordination more human and culturally rich

## Limitations

- Cannot replace direct funding mechanisms — artifacts are recognition, not capital
- Not suited for rigid KPI-based accountability
- Requires intentional culture-building to maintain meaning
- Risk of feeling hollow without genuine community context

## Best Used When

- Communities want to recognize emotional and cultural contributions
- Honoring public goods work that's difficult to price in financial terms
- Building contributor memory, belonging, and community narrative
- Integrating funding ceremonies with storytelling and cultural practice

## Examples and Use Cases

### Funding Round Recognition
At the conclusion of a grant round, top contributors and impactful projects receive Artizen Artifacts commemorating their participation and impact.

### Cultural Commons
Cultural infrastructure projects award artifacts to artists, organizers, and storytellers whose work sustains community identity.

### Contributor Journey Milestones
Contributors receive artifacts at key milestones — first contribution, one year of service, mentorship achievements — creating a visible journey through the ecosystem.
