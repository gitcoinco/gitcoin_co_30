**Category:** Allocation
**Origin Year:** 1900

Direct Grants represent the traditional approach to funding allocation, where a committee, foundation, or individual reviews applications and directly awards funds to selected projects.

While less "Web3 native" than other mechanisms, direct grants remain highly effective for certain use cases, particularly when domain expertise is needed for evaluation or when rapid decision-making is required.

Most foundations and DAOs use some form of direct grants alongside more experimental mechanisms.

## How It Works

1. Call for proposals is announced
2. Projects submit applications
3. Committee reviews and evaluates submissions
4. Selected projects receive funding
5. Often includes milestones and reporting requirements
