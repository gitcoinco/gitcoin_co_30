**Coalitional funding** is a capital allocation pattern where multiple aligned funders coordinate around a shared domain, pool or stack resources, and co-fund initiatives through a common mechanism, round, or program. Instead of a single sponsor or a fully centralized allocator, a coalition forms around a theme (e.g., security, privacy, accelerators, or public infrastructure) and each participant contributes capital, legitimacy, distribution, and/or expertise. The coalition increases total funding power, reduces individual risk, and creates positive-sum outcomes through matching, amplification, and shared signaling.

## How It Works

1. **Domain scoping:** A coalition forms around a tightly defined problem space — "Ethereum security" rather than "blockchain good things." Clear boundaries help funders align on priorities and evaluate outcomes.
2. **Convener coordination:** A neutral or trusted convener facilitates coalition formation and ongoing coordination without capturing governance or capital flow. The convener focuses on logistics, communication, and legitimacy rather than allocation decisions.
3. **Capital pooling or stacking:** Coalition members contribute capital, which may be pooled into a shared fund or stacked through co-funding commitments to a common round or program. Each dollar is amplified via matching, co-funding, or shared distribution.
4. **Mechanism-agnostic allocation:** The coalition agrees on *what* to fund, not necessarily *how*. Quadratic funding, RFPs, retroactive funding, and hybrid approaches can coexist within the same coalition, selected based on the domain and context.
5. **Expert-led legitimacy:** Early legitimacy comes from domain experts and operators who define the coalition's direction, with marketing and broader outreach following only after credibility is established.
6. **Execution and reporting:** Operators execute the funding program with transparent, competitive fee structures. Post-round impact reports are produced for funders to circulate internally, optimizing for return participation.

## Advantages

- **Capital efficiency:** Each dollar is amplified via matching, co-funding, or shared distribution, turning fragmented $1-2M efforts into coordinated $10M+ programs.
- **Collective intelligence:** Expert and stakeholder insight is pooled, directing capital toward higher-impact outcomes than any single funder could identify alone.
- **Legitimacy bootstrapping:** Funders borrow credibility from one another and from respected domain experts, making participation attractive to new coalition members.
- **Risk diversification:** No single funder bears full responsibility for outcomes, lowering the bar for participation and enabling larger commitments.
- **Domain focus:** Coalitions can form narrowly around high-signal problem spaces rather than generic "public goods," improving allocation quality.
- **Pluralism by default:** Multiple allocators, mechanisms, and operators can coexist without monopoly dynamics, allowing the best approaches to emerge organically.

## Limitations

- **Over-broad scope:** Coalitions that dilute alignment by trying to cover too many domains lose their coordination advantage.
- **Dominant funder capture:** One large funder can quietly control outcomes, undermining the coalition's pluralistic structure.
- **Mechanism fixation:** Treating the mechanism as the product instead of the coalition can lead to tool-centric thinking that ignores stakeholder needs.
- **Operator sustainability:** Ignoring the sustainability of operators who execute coalition programs leads to burnout and degraded quality over time.
- **Premature marketing:** Launching with marketing before legitimacy is earned from domain experts undermines credibility and attracts low-signal participation.

## Core Design Principles

- **Clear domain boundaries:** Coalitions work best when scoped tightly around well-defined problem spaces.
- **Credible conveners:** Coalitions need a neutral or trusted convener who focuses on coordination, not capture.
- **Mechanism-agnosticism:** The coalition agrees on what to fund, not necessarily how. QF, RFPs, retros, and hybrids can coexist.
- **Expert legitimacy first, marketing later:** Early legitimacy comes from domain experts and operators, not PR campaigns.
- **Fair fees, not hidden rents:** Operators should be compensated transparently and competitively, ideally through open or contestable structures.
- **Repeatability over novelty:** The goal is durable, reusable coordination, not one-off spectacles.

## Best Used When

Coalitional funding works best when:

- Multiple funders share alignment around a common domain or problem space
- No single funder can justify the full cost alone, but the benefits are ecosystem-wide
- Funding needs to be amplified through matching or co-funding to reach meaningful scale
- The goal is to coordinate across funders without centralizing allocation authority
- Domain expertise is distributed across multiple organizations
- Pluralism in allocation mechanisms is desired

## Examples and Use Cases

**SEMATECH (1987)** formed when 14 U.S. semiconductor firms and DARPA pooled funding to counter declining competitiveness against Japanese manufacturers. Competing companies coordinated capital for pre-competitive R&D because the benefits were ecosystem-wide and no single firm could justify the cost alone. The U.S. government matched roughly half of the consortium's ~$100M annual budget. The coalition is widely credited with helping restore U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

**The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (2002)** was created to coordinate fragmented global health funding from governments, foundations, and multilateral institutions. Funders committed capital through shared replenishment cycles while delegating execution to independent and local implementers. The coalition has mobilized over $65B and remains one of the most durable large-scale funding coalitions in history.

**The Linux Foundation (2007)** emerged as corporations recognized that shared open-source infrastructure required coordinated funding and neutral governance. Competing firms paid annual dues to support maintainers, security, and tooling without owning the software. This coalitional model enabled Linux to become critical global infrastructure across cloud, mobile, and embedded systems.

**Gitcoin Grants + Funders League (2019-2022)** coordinated matching capital from the Ethereum Foundation, protocols like Uniswap and Yearn, L2s, DAOs, and individual donors around quadratic funding rounds. Funders gained leverage, legitimacy, and brand goodwill by co-funding shared infrastructure rather than running siloed programs. The coalition mobilized tens of millions of dollars and defined the dominant on-chain public goods funding model of the era.

**Protocol Guild (2021-present)** formed as a coalition of Ethereum-aligned protocols to fund long-term core protocol contributors without relying on a single sponsor. Member protocols committed ETH or tokens into a shared pool, distributing funds to maintainers based on social consensus and contribution history. The coalition solved a classic free-rider problem by making participation a norm rather than a favor.

## Best Practices

- **Treat funders as customers:** Produce post-round impact reports they can circulate internally. Optimize for return participation, not one-time checks.
- **Make brand value legible:** Impressions, quotes from respected voices, concrete outcomes.
- **Invest in retrospectives:** Public learning compounds ecosystem-wide value.
- **Start small, then stack:** Early success attracts additional coalition members.
- **Separate governance from operations:** Domain experts set direction, operators execute.
