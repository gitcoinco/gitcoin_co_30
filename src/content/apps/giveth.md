**Giveth** is an open-source, community-driven crypto donation platform that enables zero-fee, direct blockchain donations to public goods, nonprofits, and for-good projects worldwide. Founded in 2016 as one of the earliest Ethereum-native philanthropy experiments, Giveth allows anyone to create a project page and begin receiving crypto donations across multiple chains, with 100% of each donation going directly to the recipient (excluding network gas fees).

Beyond simple crypto donations, Giveth integrates web3-native funding mechanisms designed to reward giving and amplify community signal. Its GIVbacks program distributes GIV tokens to donors who support verified projects, introducing token-based incentives to charitable giving. GIVpower enables community members to stake GIV tokens to curate projects, increasing their visibility and boosting donor reward rates. Giveth operates recurring quadratic funding (QF) rounds, distributing matching pools based on breadth of community support.

The platform hosts thousands of projects across public goods, climate initiatives, humanitarian aid, open-source software, and grassroots community efforts. It supports donations across Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Celo, Solana, and Ethereum Classic. Solana is the platform's first non-EVM integration.

Giveth sits at the intersection of blockchain philanthropy, token-incentivized giving, and public goods funding infrastructure.

## **What This Platform Does**

Giveth provides a zero-fee, multichain platform for crypto donations and nonprofit fundraising, connecting donors with public goods projects through token-based incentives and quadratic funding.

In practice, it enables:

* **Donors** to contribute crypto directly to projects across multiple blockchains with no platform fees, while earning GIV token rewards through GIVbacks when supporting verified projects  
* **For-good projects and nonprofits** to create free fundraising pages, accept multichain crypto donations, and participate in quadratic funding rounds without needing smart contract expertise  
* **Community members** to curate and prioritize projects by staking GIV for GIVpower, which increases project visibility and boosts GIVbacks reward rates  
* **Ecosystem partners** to sponsor funding rounds using Giveth's infrastructure, distributing matching pools based on decentralized community support  
* **Web3 newcomers and traditional nonprofits** to access blockchain-native fundraising through a user-friendly interface designed to bridge web2 philanthropy and web3 public goods funding

## **Features**

Giveth operates as an open-source, multichain crypto donation platform. Its core infrastructure handles project listings, donation routing, and verification workflows. Integrated incentive mechanisms (GIVbacks, GIVpower, and quadratic funding) add token-based coordination and community curation to charitable giving.

### **Core Components**

* **Donation Platform:** A zero-fee crypto donation interface where projects create fundraising pages and receive direct onchain contributions across supported networks. 100% of each donation is sent to the project wallet, with only network gas fees deducted.  
* **GIVbacks:** A donor rewards mechanism that distributes GIV tokens to contributors who donate to verified projects. Reward rates vary based on project status and GIVpower boosts, introducing token-aligned incentives into philanthropic behavior.  
* **GIVpower:** A staking-based curation system where GIV holders lock tokens to obtain GIVpower, which they allocate to projects. Projects with higher GIVpower rank more prominently and offer higher GIVbacks rates, creating a community-driven signal layer.  
* **Quadratic Funding Rounds:** Recurring matching rounds that distribute sponsor-funded pools to verified projects based on the number and diversity of contributors. Giveth integrates Gitcoin Passport for Sybil resistance and has hosted rounds supported by partners including Octant, Public Nouns, ENS, Arbitrum, and Polygon.

### **Platform Capabilities**

* **Multichain donations:** Supports crypto donations across Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Celo, Solana, and Ethereum Classic, enabling cross-ecosystem public goods funding.  
* **Project verification:** A review process that enables eligibility for GIVbacks and quadratic funding participation, providing credibility and trust signaling for donors.  
* **Zero fees:** No protocol-level fees are charged on donations. Donors and projects only incur standard network gas costs.  
* **Referral rewards:** Participants can generate referral links and earn GIV token incentives when referred donations occur, encouraging community-led growth.  
* **Multilingual platform:** Localized interface support, including Spanish and Catalan, to expand global accessibility.

## **Use Cases**

### **Nonprofits and Public Goods Projects Fundraising in Crypto**

Nonprofits, DAOs, and grassroots initiatives use Giveth to accept crypto donations globally without platform fees. The platform serves as a blockchain fundraising layer for organizations entering web3, offering direct donations, access to quadratic funding rounds, and community-driven curation.

### **Donors Seeking Rewarded Giving**

Crypto holders use Giveth to support aligned projects while earning GIV tokens through GIVbacks. Unlike traditional donation platforms, which offer limited feedback loops, Giveth introduces programmable incentives that align donor participation with ecosystem growth.

### **Ecosystem Partners Running Quadratic Funding Rounds**

Ecosystem organizations sponsor matching pools through Giveth's funding infrastructure to support aligned public goods. Integrated identity verification (Gitcoin Passport) and multichain support allow partners to deploy matching capital using community-driven allocation mechanisms.

### **Community-Led Project Curation and Signal Amplification**

GIV holders use GIVpower to curate and elevate projects they believe in. This staking-based coordination layer complements formal verification, creating a decentralized reputation and prioritization system.
