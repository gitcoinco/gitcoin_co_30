Grants Stack is a decentralized, modular protocol for running grants programs. It enables communities to fund their shared needs through quadratic funding, direct grants, and other mechanisms. Built on the Allo Protocol, it has distributed over $60M to open source projects since 2019. GG23 (December 2024) distributed $1.2M+ across 235 projects in the core rounds.
