**Base Builder Grants** is a retroactive grants program operated by the Base team at Coinbase, providing fast ETH-denominated funding to builders who have already shipped projects or made meaningful contributions to the Base Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem. Grants typically range from 1 to 5 ETH per recipient and are distributed in publicly announced cohorts on X and Farcaster.

The program is built on a simple operating principle: reward shipped work. Rather than requiring proposals or formal applications, Builder Grants identify recipients through ecosystem activity, community nominations, and direct discovery by the Base team. Funding is awarded after work is live – prioritizing execution over intent.

Since launching in March 2024, the program has distributed grants across more than 20 cohorts. Builder Grants are one component of Base's broader funding stack alongside the Base Ecosystem Fund (pre-seed and seed investments led by Coinbase Ventures), Optimism RetroPGF (available to Base builders as an OP Stack chain and member of the Optimism Superchain), the Builder Rewards Program (ongoing ETH incentives), and Base Batches (an accelerator for teams pursuing full-time development).

## **What This Program Does**

Base Builder Grants deliver rapid, low-friction retroactive funding to builders contributing tangible value to the Base ecosystem.

In practice, it enables:

* **Early-stage builders** to receive ETH grants for shipped prototypes, side projects, and experiments without preparing formal grant applications  
* **Application developers** to be rewarded for deploying functional products on Base mainnet that demonstrate real usage or ecosystem utility  
* **Developer tool builders** to receive support for open-source libraries, analytics dashboards, deployment tooling, browser extensions, and infrastructure that improves the Base developer experience  
* **Content creators and community organizers** to earn grants for educational resources, tutorials, documentation, and programs that onboard and support builders  
* **Ecosystem contributors** to be recognized for creative, technical, or cross-chain work that expands Base's capabilities and cultural footprint

The program emphasizes speed, accessibility, and demonstrated output, lowering barriers for early contributors while reinforcing a culture of building in public.

## **Features**

Base Builder Grants operates as a team-managed, retroactive grant program within Base's ecosystem support infrastructure. Discovery, evaluation, and disbursement are handled directly by the Base team, without token-holder voting or onchain allocation mechanisms.

### **Core Components**

* **Retroactive evaluation:** The review team – composed of builders and ecosystem leads within Base – identifies and evaluates recipients based on live work rather than proposals. Discovery occurs through ecosystem monitoring, social channels, and community nomination submissions.  
* **Recurring cohort announcements:** Grant recipients are announced in numbered cohorts, providing visibility, recognition, and social proof alongside financial support.  
* **Community nomination process:** Anyone can nominate a builder via a public form. Submissions are reviewed but responses are not guaranteed; the team contacts selected recipients directly.  
* **KYC and compliance:** Selected recipients complete W8 or W9 documentation before funds are distributed to ensure regulatory compliance.

### **Program Characteristics**

* **ETH-denominated grants:** Awards typically range from 1 to 5 ETH per recipient, offering meaningful early-stage support while remaining lightweight and fast.  
* **Broad contribution scope:** Eligible work spans applications, developer tooling, infrastructure, data analytics, creative projects, content, and community initiatives.  
* **Iterative program design:** The program is described by the Base team as experimental and adaptive, with cohort size, selection criteria, and grant amounts evolving over time.  
* **Part of a progression pathway:** Builder Grants often serve as an entry point into Base's funding ecosystem, with recipients progressing to Base Batches, the Base Ecosystem Fund, or Optimism RetroPGF.

## **Use Cases**

### **Application Developers Shipping on Base Mainnet**

Developers deploying functional applications on Base mainnet – including payments infrastructure, games, social apps, and DeFi interfaces – receive Builder Grants as retroactive recognition for live products. The program rewards deployed contracts and working applications over speculative proposals.

### **Developer Tooling and Infrastructure Builders**

Builders creating tools that improve the Base developer experience receive grants for utilities such as gas optimization tools, deployment frameworks, cross-chain migration infrastructure, analytics dashboards, and other public goods-style contributions. These tools often serve other builders rather than end users directly.

### **Community Builders and Content Creators**

Creators producing documentation, tutorials, explainers, workshops, and ecosystem education resources are eligible for retroactive grants. Community organizers supporting onboarding, hackathons, and builder meetups may also receive recognition for measurable ecosystem impact.

### **Creative and Experimental Projects**

Artists and developers exploring novel onchain formats – including NFT experiments, generative art systems, social protocols, and reputation mechanisms – receive grants for pushing the creative and technical boundaries of what is possible on Base. The program intentionally supports experimentation alongside production-grade applications.
