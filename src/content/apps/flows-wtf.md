**Flows.wtf** is a decentralized, AI-powered capital allocation platform that enables continuous streaming of funds to approved recipients through community curation. Built on top of the Nouns DAO ecosystem, Flows uses token curated registries (TCRs) to let communities collectively decide which projects receive ongoing funding, with funds accruing and distributing second-by-second via onchain smart contracts.

By early 2026, the platform reported 605 builders funded across active flows spanning multiple ecosystems including Higher, Zora, and Farcaster. Flows represents the latest evolution in Nouns DAO's capital deployment infrastructure — moving from discrete governance proposals to competitive Prop House rounds to continuous, permissionless streaming.

## What This Platform Does

Flows.wtf enables communities to set up focused funding streams where recipients receive continuous payments rather than one-time grants. The platform coordinates:

- **Continuous fund streaming** where approved recipients receive funds second-by-second, claimable at any time through compatible EVM wallets
- **Community curation** through token curated registries, where purchasing a flow's ERC20 token makes you a curator for that stream
- **Permissionless applications** where anyone can apply for a grant by selecting the flow that fits their project
- **Curator incentives** with 10% of flow budgets distributed to token holders, rewarding active participation in curation

The system is governed by Nouns holders via L2 proofs, maintaining alignment with the broader Nouns governance structure while enabling faster, more granular capital allocation.

## Features

### Token Curated Registries

Each flow operates as a token curated registry with its own ERC20 token. Purchasing tokens grants curation rights for that specific flow, creating a skin-in-the-game evaluation mechanism. Curators decide which applicants join or leave a flow, with economic incentives aligned through token value and reward distribution.

### Continuous Fund Streaming

Unlike discrete grant rounds or one-time transfers, Flows distributes funds through a mechanism for second-by-second accrual using `block.timestamp`. Recipients can claim accumulated funds at any time through any compatible EVM wallet, eliminating funding gaps between rounds and providing predictable income for builders.

### Focused Flows

Each flow has a specific focus and budget, defined by the community funding it. Active flows span ecosystem development, content creation, developer tooling, and community building across multiple token ecosystems. This scoped structure enables specialized curation within each domain.

### AI-Powered Allocation

The platform integrates AI tooling to assist with capital allocation decisions, helping curators evaluate applications and track funded project outcomes at scale.

### Open Infrastructure

Flows.wtf provides open-source protocol code, a public API, and audited smart contracts. The protocol is designed as public infrastructure that can be adopted by any community, following the same trajectory as Prop House's evolution from Nouns-specific tooling to general-purpose infrastructure.

## Use Cases

### Ecosystem Builder Programs

Token communities use Flows to establish ongoing builder programs where contributors receive continuous payments for ecosystem development work. Unlike one-time grants, streaming payments provide income stability and reduce the overhead of repeated application cycles.

### Community-Curated Grants

DAOs and communities that lack the governance bandwidth for individual proposal evaluation use Flows' TCR mechanism to delegate curation to economically incentivized community members, scaling capital deployment without centralizing decision-making.

### Cross-Ecosystem Funding

Multiple token ecosystems (Higher, Zora, Farcaster) run flows distributing their native tokens to builders, demonstrating the platform's adaptability across different communities and token economies.

### Sustainability-Focused Incubation

Nouns DAO Proposal 794 proposed reframing Flows as "an onchain Y Combinator," exploring revenue-backed tokens (revnets) in partnership with Juicebox where funded projects commit a minimum 10% of revnet tokens back to Nouns DAO — an attempt to move from extractive grant-making to generative funding that builds self-sustaining projects.
