Octant is a participatory public goods funding platform built by the Golem Foundation. 100,000 ETH is staked and the rewards fund public goods projects. Users lock GLM tokens to participate in allocation decisions. Octant runs 90-day epochs; Epoch 9 is currently active as of late 2024. Each epoch typically distributes $1-2M to selected projects.
