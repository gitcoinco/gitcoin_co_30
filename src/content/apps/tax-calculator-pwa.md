**Tax Calculator PWA** is a lightweight, mobile-first **progressive web app** designed to make common tax calculations fast and error-resistant.

It’s intentionally simple: open it, type a number, get the exact breakdown you need—no spreadsheets, no menus, no clutter.

## What This App Does

- **VAT (부가세) calculator**: convert between pre-tax / VAT / total, including reverse-calculation from tax-inclusive amounts.
- **Withholding (원천징수) calculator**: compute withholding amount and net payout for common withholding rates.
- **Rounding clarity**: explicit rounding display so you can copy numbers into invoices or payment requests.

## Who It’s For

- Freelancers and solo operators who frequently need quick tax breakdowns
- Creators and small businesses who issue invoices and want consistent calculations
- Anyone who wants a tiny “calculator that remembers tax rules” on their home screen

## Notes

- This is a PWA intended to be **installed to the phone home screen** for one-tap access.
- The goal is speed and correctness for daily operations, not exhaustive tax filing.
